## Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models (such as CNNs, ResNet, or EfficientNet) to classify skin lesion images. The application is intended for educational and research purposes.

## Features

- Automatic classification of skin lesion images into benign and malignant.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing pipeline for robust training.
- Transfer learning using pre-trained models.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualization of predictions and model performance.
- Easy-to-use CLI or web interface for inference.

## Dataset

The project uses the [ISIC Skin Lesion Dataset](https://isic-archive.com/) or a similar open dataset. The dataset consists of high-resolution dermatoscopic images labeled by dermatologists.

- *Number of Images:* ~25,000
- *Classes:* Benign, Malignant
- *Format:* JPEG/PNG images and CSV metadata

*Note:* Please download the dataset from the official source and place it in the data/ directory.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using deep convolutional neural networks. Common architectures used include:

- ResNet50
- EfficientNetB0/B3
- Custom CNN

The model pipeline includes:

1. Image preprocessing and augmentation.
2. Feature extraction using transfer learning.
3. Classification head (Dense layers with softmax/sigmoid activation).

## Installation

1. *Clone the repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritupriya17/Skin-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd Skin-Cancer-Detection
   

2. *Set up a virtual environment:*
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. *Install dependencies:*
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. *Download the dataset:*
   - Download from the official ISIC Archive or the provided link.
   - Place images in the data/ folder.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Configure parameters in config.yaml (if available) or edit the training script.

bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch-size 32 --model resnet50


### Inference

To make predictions on new images:

bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg


### Web Interface

If a web interface is available (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask):

bash
streamlit run app.py
# or
python app.py

Then open the provided local URL in your browser.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

Example:

bash
python evaluate.py --model saved_model.h5 --test-dir data/test


## Results

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| ResNet50      | 0.89     | 0.88      | 0.87   | 0.87     | 0.92    |
| EfficientNetB0| 0.91     | 0.90      | 0.89   | 0.89     | 0.94    |

Results may vary depending on dataset and hyperparameters.
